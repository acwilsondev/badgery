# Epic 3: Achievement Assignment & Tracking

Aligns with Milestone 1: Foundation & CI/CD

_Note: This Epic was promoted from STORY-2.2 in the original plan._

## User Stories

### STORY-3.1: Manual Achievement Assignment UI (AI Complexity: **S**)

**As an** organization administrator,  
**I want** a user-friendly interface to manually assign achievements,  
**So that** I can recognize users' accomplishments through the web interface.

**Tasks:**

- Design and implement achievement assignment UI
- Create user search and selection functionality
- Build assignment confirmation workflow
- Implement validation for assignment eligibility
- Add comments and attribution for manual assignments

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Admins can search for and select users to assign achievements
- Assignment validation prevents invalid assignments
- Assignments include optional comments and attribution
- Users receive notifications for manual assignments

**AI Complexity: S**
Creating an interface for manual achievement assignment follows standard UI patterns for search, selection, and form submission. The complexity is in designing an intuitive workflow and proper validation.

### STORY-3.2: API-Based Achievement Assignment (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** developer,  
**I want** API endpoints for programmatic achievement assignment,  
**So that** external systems can assign achievements based on actions in those systems.

**Tasks:**

- Design API endpoints for achievement assignment
- Implement authentication and authorization checks
- Create validation logic for API-based assignments
- Build rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Add detailed logging for API assignments

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- API endpoints allow external systems to assign achievements
- Authentication and authorization properly restrict access
- Validation ensures all required data is provided
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- All API assignments are logged for audit purposes

**AI Complexity: M**
Implementing API-based achievement assignment requires careful authentication and validation. The complexity comes from ensuring secure access while maintaining flexibility for different integration scenarios.

### STORY-3.3: Progress Tracking Mechanism (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As an** end user,  
**I want** my progress towards multi-step achievements to be tracked,  
**So that** I can see my advancement towards completion.

**Tasks:**

- Design progress tracking data model
- Implement progress update mechanisms
- Create progress calculation algorithms
- Build progress visualization components
- Add progress event logging

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Progress towards multi-step achievements is tracked accurately
- Progress updates are processed in real-time
- Users can view their current progress
- Progress history is maintainable for audit purposes

**AI Complexity: M**
Tracking progress requires designing a flexible system that accommodates different achievement types. The complexity arises from implementing progress calculation logic that handles various achievement structures.

### STORY-3.4: Tiered/Leveled Achievement Support (AI Complexity: **S**)

**As an** organization administrator,  
**I want** to create achievements with multiple levels or tiers,  
**So that** users can progress through different stages of an achievement.

**Tasks:**

- Design tiered achievement data model
- Implement tier progression rules
- Create tier visualization in UI
- Build tier transition notifications
- Add tier-specific badge variations

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Achievements can be configured with multiple tiers
- Progression between tiers follows defined rules
- Tier status is clearly displayed in the UI
- Users are notified when progressing to a new tier

**AI Complexity: S**
Implementing tiered achievements requires extending the basic achievement model with progression rules. While it builds on the existing achievement system, the complexity is relatively contained.

## Comments

As an engineer implementing this epic, I recommend:

- Implement an event-sourcing approach for tracking achievement progress to maintain a complete history
- Design the progress tracking system to be asynchronous using event queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, SQS) for better scalability
- For the assignment UI, create batch assignment capabilities for efficiency
- Implement proper idempotency in the API endpoints to prevent duplicate assignments
- Consider performance implications of progress calculations - pre-compute where possible
- Use WebSockets or SSE for real-time progress updates in the UI
- For tiered achievements, design a system that allows retroactive tier calculations if rules change
- Add comprehensive logging and analytics to track assignment patterns
- Implement a rollback mechanism for incorrectly assigned achievements
- Design API rate limiting based on both authentication token and IP address
- Create a sandbox environment for testing API integrations
- Consider implementing achievement expiration functionality for time-limited achievements
