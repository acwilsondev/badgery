*Note: This Epic was promoted from STORY-8.2 in the original plan.*

## Milestone Alignment

Aligns with Milestone 3: Scaling & Optimization

## User Stories

### STORY-14.1: Load Testing Framework (AI Complexity: **L**)

**As a** platform operator,  
**I want** a comprehensive load testing framework,  
**So that** I can verify system performance under various conditions.

**Tasks:**

- Design load testing architecture
- Implement realistic user scenario simulations
- Create automated load test execution
- Build performance metrics collection
- Add test result analysis tools

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- System can be tested under various load scenarios
- Tests simulate realistic user behavior
- Load tests run automatically in non-production environments
- Performance metrics are collected during tests
- Results provide actionable insights into bottlenecks

**AI Complexity: L**
Creating a load testing framework requires understanding of distributed systems and performance characteristics. The high complexity comes from designing tests that accurately reflect real-world usage patterns.

### STORY-14.2: Horizontal Scaling Implementation (AI Complexity: **XL**)

**As a** platform operator,  
**I want** the system to scale horizontally across multiple servers,  
**So that** it can handle increasing user loads efficiently.

**Tasks:**

- Design horizontally scalable architecture
- Implement stateless application components
- Create distributed caching layer
- Build auto-scaling configuration
- Add load balancing optimization

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- System components can run on multiple servers simultaneously
- Scaling occurs automatically based on load
- Performance remains consistent as system scales
- No single points of failure exist
- Resource utilization is optimized across the cluster

**AI Complexity: XL**
Implementing horizontal scaling requires deep knowledge of distributed systems architecture. The very high complexity comes from ensuring data consistency and performance across a distributed system.

### STORY-14.3: Database Scaling Strategy (AI Complexity: **L**)

**As a** platform operator,  
**I want** a scalable database architecture,  
**So that** data storage can grow without performance degradation.

**Tasks:**

- Design database scaling approach (sharding, replication)
- Implement read replicas for query distribution
- Create data partitioning strategy
- Build database migration tools
- Add database performance monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Database can scale to handle increasing data volumes
- Read operations are distributed for load balancing
- Data is partitioned logically for performance
- Migrations can be performed with minimal downtime
- Performance metrics track scaling effectiveness

**AI Complexity: L**
Database scaling requires deep understanding of data access patterns and database architectures. The high complexity comes from maintaining data integrity and query performance while scaling.

### STORY-14.4: Cache Optimization Strategy (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** platform operator,  
**I want** an effective caching strategy across the platform,  
**So that** frequently accessed data is served quickly and database load is reduced.

**Tasks:**

- Design multi-level caching architecture
- Implement distributed cache (Redis/Memcached)
- Create cache invalidation strategies
- Build cache warming mechanisms
- Add cache hit/miss monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Frequently accessed data is cached appropriately
- Cache invalidation maintains data consistency
- Cache is distributed across multiple nodes
- Cold starts are minimized with cache warming
- Cache effectiveness is measured and optimized

**AI Complexity: M**
Implementing caching requires understanding of data access patterns and caching principles. The complexity comes from creating effective cache invalidation strategies that maintain data consistency.

## Comments

As an engineer implementing this epic, I recommend:

- Use cloud-native load testing tools (e.g., k6, Locust) with realistic user behavior modeling
- Implement infrastructure-as-code (IaC) for all scalability components to ensure reproducibility
- Consider implementing blue/green deployments for zero-downtime scaling operations
- Use database connection pooling with appropriate sizing for workload characteristics
- Consider implementing a CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern for better scalability
- Implement proper database index strategies with regular maintenance (reindexing schedules)
- Consider using materialized views for frequently accessed but infrequently changing data
- Implement database sharding with consistent hashing to allow for future expansion
- Use write-through caching for critical data to ensure consistency
- Implement TTL (Time To Live) strategies based on data update frequency
- Consider using an event-sourcing pattern for high-write scenarios with eventual consistency
- Implement proper circuit breakers and bulkhead patterns for resilient scaling
- Use feature flags to control rollout of scaling features and enable quick rollbacks
- Consider container orchestration (Kubernetes) for automated scaling and deployment
- Implement proper resource quotas and limits to prevent resource starvation
- Add chaos engineering practices to verify resilience during scaling events
- Consider implementing backpressure mechanisms for systems under heavy load
- Use asynchronous processing (message queues) for non-immediate operations
