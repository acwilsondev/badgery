# Epic 13: Performance Monitoring & Optimization

_Note: This Epic was promoted from STORY-8.1 in the original plan._

Aligns with Milestone 3: Scaling & Optimization

## User Stories

### STORY-13.1: Monitoring Infrastructure Setup (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** platform operator,  
**I want** comprehensive monitoring infrastructure,  
**So that** I can track system performance and health.

**Tasks:**

- Design monitoring architecture
- Implement metrics collection system
- Create performance dashboards
- Build alerting mechanisms
- Add log aggregation and analysis

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Key performance metrics are collected and stored
- Dashboards provide real-time visibility into system health
- Alerts trigger when metrics exceed thresholds
- Logs are centralized and searchable
- Historical performance data is retained for trend analysis

**AI Complexity: M**
Setting up monitoring infrastructure requires integration with various systems and careful metric selection. The complexity comes from creating a comprehensive monitoring solution that captures relevant data without excessive overhead.

### STORY-13.2: Database Performance Optimization (AI Complexity: **L**)

**As a** platform operator,  
**I want** to optimize database performance,  
**So that** queries are fast and efficient even at scale.

**Tasks:**

- Analyze database query patterns
- Implement index optimization
- Create query caching strategy
- Build database scaling plan
- Add query performance monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Database queries consistently perform under target thresholds
- Indexes are optimized for common query patterns
- Query caching reduces database load
- Database can scale horizontally as needed
- Slow queries are identified and optimized

**AI Complexity: L**
Database optimization requires deep understanding of query patterns and database internals. The high complexity comes from balancing performance improvements with data integrity and maintenance concerns.

### STORY-13.3: Frontend Performance Optimization (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** user,  
**I want** a fast and responsive user interface,  
**So that** I can interact with the platform efficiently.

**Tasks:**

- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize asset delivery
- Create progressive web app capabilities
- Build client-side caching strategy
- Add performance monitoring for frontend

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Pages load within performance budget targets
- Assets are optimized for size and loading speed
- Application works offline when possible
- Client-side caching reduces network requests
- Core web vitals meet or exceed industry standards

**AI Complexity: M**
Frontend optimization requires understanding of modern web performance techniques. The complexity comes from implementing optimizations that improve performance without degrading user experience.

### STORY-13.4: API Performance Optimization (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** developer,  
**I want** high-performance API endpoints,  
**So that** integrations are responsive and efficient.

**Tasks:**

- Design API caching strategy
- Implement response compression
- Create batched operations
- Build request throttling and prioritization
- Add performance benchmarking

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- API response times consistently meet performance targets
- Caching reduces load on backend services
- Responses are compressed to minimize transfer size
- Batched operations reduce number of requests
- Performance metrics are tracked and visible

**AI Complexity: M**
API optimization requires balancing performance with flexibility and reliability. The complexity comes from implementing caching and other optimizations while maintaining correct behavior.


## Comments

As an engineer implementing this epic, I recommend:

- Implement distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) for end-to-end request visibility
- Use APM tools (New Relic, Datadog, etc.) rather than building monitoring from scratch
- Create custom dashboards for specific business metrics beyond technical performance
- Implement database query analysis with execution plans to identify optimization opportunities
- Consider implementation of read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Use connection pooling for database connections to reduce overhead
- Implement a time-series metrics database for efficient storage and retrieval
- Add synthetic monitoring to simulate user flows for proactive detection
- Consider CDC (Change Data Capture) for efficient data synchronization
- Implement proper cache invalidation strategies to prevent stale data
- Add automated performance regression testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Implement graceful degradation strategies for system under extreme load
- Consider implementing a service mesh for advanced traffic control
- Add real user monitoring (RUM) for actual user experience metrics
- Implement rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse
- Add circuit breakers for dependency failure isolation
- Consider applying CQRS pattern for better read/write performance separation
- Use profiling tools to identify code-level bottlenecks
