### STORY-1.1: Modern Application Stack Setup (AI Complexity: **S**)

**I want** a Remix application with the latest React features and TypeScript configurations
**So that** the codebase is built on modern, performant technologies from the start.

**Tasks:**

- Initialize Remix v2+ application with React 18+ features
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Set up ESLint and Prettier with enforced code style rules
- Configure path aliases for cleaner imports

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Application uses latest stable versions of Remix and React
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled with proper type checking
- Code styling is automatically enforced via ESLint and Prettier
- Developers can use consistent import patterns with path aliases

**AI Complexity: S** Setting up a modern application stack requires knowledge of current JavaScript frameworks and tooling but follows established patterns.
