# Epic 4: User Achievement Dashboard

Aligns with Milestone 1: Foundation & CI/CD

## Description

This epic covers the implementation of a user dashboard that displays achievements earned by the user. The dashboard enables users to view, track, and showcase their accomplishments in a personalized interface.

## User Stories

### STORY-4.1: User Achievement Dashboard (AI Complexity: **XS**)

**As an** end user,  
**I want** a personal dashboard to view my achievements,  
**So that** I can track my progress and showcase my accomplishments.

**Tasks:**

- Design and implement user dashboard UI
- Create achievement display components
- Build filtering and sorting functionality
- Implement achievement detail view
- Add progress visualization for incomplete achievements

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users can view all their achievements in one place
- Achievements can be filtered and sorted
- Progress towards incomplete achievements is clearly displayed
- Achievement details can be viewed

**AI Complexity: XS**
Creating a dashboard UI for displaying achievements follows standard UI patterns and primarily involves front-end development with data retrieval. The visualization aspects are straightforward and follow common dashboard design principles.

## Comments

As an engineer implementing this epic, I recommend:

- Implement virtualized lists for achievement displays to handle potentially large numbers of achievements
- Use responsive design principles to ensure the dashboard works well on mobile devices
- Consider implementing dashboard widgets that can be customized by users
- Add social sharing functionality to allow users to share achievements on platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
- Implement keyboard navigation and accessibility features (WCAG compliance)
- Add printable/exportable achievement reports (PDF format)
- Consider implementing achievement showcase features where users can highlight selected achievements
- Create persistent filter/sort preferences that are saved between sessions
- Add search functionality for users with many achievements
- Consider implementing achievement comparisons between time periods (monthly/yearly stats)
- Add metrics on dashboard that show achievement acquisition rate over time
- Use skeleton loading states for better perceived performance
