# Epic 10: Privacy Controls

_Note: This Epic was promoted from STORY-5.2 in the original plan._

Aligns with Milestone 2: Feature Expansion

## User Stories

### STORY-10.1: User Privacy Settings (AI Complexity: **S**)

**As a** user,  
**I want** granular privacy settings for my profile and achievements,  
**So that** I can control what information is visible to others.

**Tasks:**

- Design user privacy settings interface
- Implement privacy preference storage
- Create visibility controls for profile elements
- Build achievement sharing settings
- Add privacy setting enforcement

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users can set privacy preferences for their profile
- Different visibility levels (public, private, organization-only) are available
- Achievement visibility can be controlled individually
- Privacy settings are enforced consistently across the platform

**AI Complexity: S**
Creating privacy settings involves designing a user-friendly interface and implementing visibility rules. The complexity is moderate, focusing on comprehensive but intuitive controls.

### STORY-10.2: Data Export Functionality (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** user,  
**I want** to export all my data from the platform,  
**So that** I can maintain personal copies or transfer to another service.

**Tasks:**

- Design data export architecture
- Implement comprehensive data collection
- Create export format options (JSON, CSV)
- Build asynchronous export processing
- Add export notification and delivery

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users can request a complete export of their data
- Multiple export formats are supported
- Large exports are processed asynchronously
- Users are notified when exports are ready
- Exports include all user-related data

**AI Complexity: M**
Implementing data export requires aggregating data across multiple systems and formatting it consistently. The complexity comes from ensuring completeness while handling potentially large datasets.

### STORY-10.3: Consent Management System (AI Complexity: **L**)

**As a** platform operator,  
**I want** a comprehensive consent management system,  
**So that** user permissions for data usage comply with privacy regulations.

**Tasks:**

- Design consent management architecture
- Implement consent collection and storage
- Create consent version management
- Build consent audit trail
- Add consent expiration and renewal

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User consent is collected for various data processing activities
- Consent records are stored with timestamps and versions
- Consent changes are tracked in an immutable audit trail
- Expired consent triggers appropriate renewal workflows
- Consent status is considered in all data processing

**AI Complexity: L**
Creating a consent management system requires understanding complex privacy regulations and implementing compliant workflows. The high complexity comes from handling various consent scenarios while maintaining regulatory compliance.

### STORY-10.4: Data Retention Controls (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As an** administrator,  
**I want** configurable data retention policies,  
**So that** data is automatically archived or deleted according to requirements.

**Tasks:**

- Design data retention framework
- Implement retention period configuration
- Create data archiving mechanism
- Build data anonymization processes
- Add retention exception handling

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Retention periods can be configured for different data types
- Data is automatically archived or deleted when retention expires
- Archiving preserves data in a storage-efficient format
- Anonymization removes personal identifiers when appropriate
- Legal holds can override normal retention for selected data

**AI Complexity: M**
Implementing data retention controls requires balancing automated processes with compliance requirements. The complexity comes from handling different data types with appropriate retention strategies.

## Comments

As an engineer implementing this epic, I recommend:

- Implement a centralized privacy preference service rather than scattered settings
- Design with Privacy by Default principles - most restrictive settings as default
- Create a privacy dashboard to visualize data collection and usage
- Implement data minimization practices throughout the application
- Consider implementing a GDPR-compliant consent mechanism with affirmative opt-in
- Add support for regional privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, etc.)
- Implement a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) process for new features
- Create a data inventory to track all personal data stored in the system
- Implement proper pseudonymization and anonymization techniques
- Consider offering a "right to be forgotten" workflow that preserves system integrity
- Add granular cookie consent controls with rejection options
- Create privacy policy version control with change notifications
- Implement data subject access request (DSAR) workflows for privacy requests
- Consider privacy implications in analytics by preferring aggregate over individual data
- Add data portability with standard, machine-readable formats
- Implement appropriate security measures for privacy data (encryption, access controls)
- Create automated privacy compliance testing within the CI/CD pipeline
