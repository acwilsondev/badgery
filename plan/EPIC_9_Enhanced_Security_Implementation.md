# Epic 9: Enhanced Security Implementation

_Note: This Epic was promoted from STORY-4.3 in the original plan._

Aligns with Milestone 2: Feature Expansion

## User Stories

### STORY-9.1: Advanced Authentication Options (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** user,  
**I want** additional authentication methods beyond passwords,  
**So that** my account is more secure and convenient to access.

**Tasks:**

- Design multi-factor authentication system
- Implement 2FA with SMS or authenticator apps
- Create social login integrations
- Build passwordless authentication options
- Add biometric authentication support

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users can enable multi-factor authentication
- Multiple 2FA methods are supported
- Social login (Google, GitHub, etc.) is available
- Passwordless login options work reliably
- Biometric authentication works on supported devices

**AI Complexity: M**
Implementing advanced authentication requires integration with various security protocols and services. The complexity comes from ensuring secure implementation across different authentication methods.

### STORY-9.2: Role-Based Access Control System (AI Complexity: **L**)

**As an** administrator,  
**I want** a sophisticated role-based access control system,  
**So that** I can precisely control permissions across the platform.

**Tasks:**

- Design comprehensive RBAC architecture
- Implement role hierarchy and inheritance
- Create fine-grained permission controls
- Build permission evaluation engine
- Add dynamic permission rules

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Complex role hierarchies can be defined
- Permissions are granular down to specific actions
- Permission inheritance works correctly
- Permission checks are performant even with complex rules
- Dynamic rules can adjust permissions based on context

**AI Complexity: L**
Creating a sophisticated RBAC system requires deep understanding of security models and access control patterns. The complexity is high due to the need for both flexibility and performance.

### STORY-9.3: Security Audit Logging (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As an** administrator,  
**I want** comprehensive security audit logs,  
**So that** I can monitor and investigate security-related events.

**Tasks:**

- Design security audit logging system
- Implement secure log storage
- Create log filtering and search
- Build log visualization tools
- Add automated alerting for suspicious activities

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Security events are logged with detailed context
- Logs are stored securely and immutably
- Logs can be searched and filtered effectively
- Visualization helps identify patterns
- Suspicious activities trigger appropriate alerts

**AI Complexity: M**
Implementing security audit logging requires careful design to capture relevant information without overwhelming storage or impacting performance. The complexity comes from balancing detail with efficiency.

### STORY-9.4: Data Encryption System (AI Complexity: **L**)

**As a** platform operator,  
**I want** comprehensive data encryption throughout the system,  
**So that** sensitive information is protected at rest and in transit.

**Tasks:**

- Design encryption strategy for different data types
- Implement data-at-rest encryption
- Create secure key management system
- Build encrypted backups
- Add field-level encryption for sensitive data

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Encryption keys are managed securely
- Backups are encrypted with recoverable keys
- Especially sensitive fields have additional encryption layers
- Encryption doesn't significantly impact performance

**AI Complexity: L**
Implementing a comprehensive encryption system requires deep understanding of cryptographic principles and key management. The complexity is high due to the need for both security and performance.

## Comments

As an engineer implementing this epic, I recommend:

- Implement FIDO2/WebAuthn for passwordless authentication with hardware security keys
- Consider using a dedicated identity provider (Auth0, Okta, etc.) rather than building from scratch
- Implement proper key rotation schedules for all encryption keys
- Use HSM (Hardware Security Module) for critical key storage in production
- Add support for PGP/GPG encryption for data exports
- Implement JWT token blacklisting/revocation mechanism for compromised sessions
- Add support for IP-based restrictions for administrative accounts
- Implement geo-fencing for suspicious login attempts from unusual locations
- Consider using a WAF (Web Application Firewall) for additional protection
- Implement continuous security monitoring with automated vulnerability scanning
- Add protection against common attacks (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection, etc.)
- Implement proper secrets management with vault solutions (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Add brute force protection with progressive delays and account lockouts
- Implement SMTP authentication for email security (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Consider implementing security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.) and achieving an A+ on SSL Labs
- Add session timeout policies based on user inactivity
- Implement data classification to apply appropriate security controls
- Consider security from the beginning with a threat modeling approach
