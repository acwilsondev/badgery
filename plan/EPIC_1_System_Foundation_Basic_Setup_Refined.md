# Epic 1: System Foundation & Basic Setup (Refined)

This epic focuses on establishing the foundational elements of the Achievement Tracking Platform, including the project setup, development environment, and CI/CD pipeline, incorporating recommendations from engineering best practices.

## User Stories

### STORY-1.2: Containerized Development Environment (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** developer
**I want** a consistent containerized development environment
**So that** all team members can work with identical dependencies and configurations.

**Tasks:**

- Create Docker development configuration with hot reloading
- Implement Docker production configuration with optimizations
- Configure appropriate volume mounting for efficient development
- Add container health checks for all services
- Set up multi-stage builds to optimize container size
- Create Docker Compose for local development with dependent services

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Developers can start the application with a single Docker command
- Changes to code are immediately reflected via hot reloading
- Production builds are optimized for performance and size
- Health checks verify container status for orchestration tools
- Local environment includes all necessary dependent services

**AI Complexity: M** Configuring Docker environments requires understanding of containerization concepts and service orchestration.

### STORY-1.3: Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** developer
**I want** a robust CI/CD pipeline with separate workflows and security scanning
**So that** code can be developed, tested, and deployed consistently and securely.

**Tasks:**

- Configure GitHub Actions with separate workflows for PR checks and deployments - Implement automated testing in the CI pipeline - Set up security scanning with Snyk or Dependabot - Create PR deployment previews for easier code reviews - Configure environment-specific validation for configuration files - Implement database migration automation within the CI/CD process

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- PRs are automatically checked for code quality, tests, and security issues
- Separate workflows exist for PR checks vs. production deployments
- Security scanning automatically detects vulnerabilities
- Each PR has an isolated preview deployment for review
- Configuration files are validated before deployment
- Database migrations run automatically as part of deployment

**AI Complexity: M** Setting up comprehensive CI/CD requires understanding of DevOps practices and tools while addressing security concerns.

### STORY-1.4: Environment Configuration Management (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** developer
**I want** properly managed environment-specific configurations with validation
**So that** the application can run correctly in different environments with appropriate settings.

**Tasks:**

- Create environment-specific configuration files with validation
- Implement secrets management for sensitive configuration
- Set up runtime configuration validation
- Create configuration documentation
- Implement feature flags infrastructure for gradual rollouts
- Configure logging levels appropriate for different environments

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Application validates configuration at startup
- Configuration can be overridden per environment
- Secrets are securely managed and not committed to source control
- Documentation clearly explains all configuration options
- Features can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- Logging is appropriate for each environment (verbose in dev, minimal in prod)

**AI Complexity: M** Environment configuration requires knowledge of security practices and configuration management patterns.

### STORY-1.5: End-to-End Testing Framework (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** developer
**I want** containerized end-to-end tests with a modern testing framework
**So that** application functionality can be verified in a production-like environment.

**Tasks:**

- Set up Playwright or Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Configure containerized test execution
- Implement visual regression testing
- Create test fixtures and utilities
- Set up test reporting and dashboards
- Configure accessibility testing within E2E tests

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- End-to-end tests run in containers that match production
- Tests can be run locally or in CI
- Visual changes are automatically detected and flagged
- Test data can be easily generated or reset
- Test results are clearly reported with failure details
- Accessibility issues are automatically detected

**AI Complexity: M** Setting up comprehensive E2E testing requires understanding of testing frameworks and containerization.

## Comments

As an engineer implementing this epic, I recommend:

- Use Remix v2+ with the newest React 18+ features for better performance
- Consider setting up a monorepo structure (using Turborepo or similar) if we anticipate having shared packages
- For Docker, include both development and production configurations with proper volume mounting for hot reloading
- Implement health checks in Docker configurations for better container orchestration
- Set up ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode from day one
- For CI/CD, configure separate workflows for PR checks vs. deployments
- Consider using environment-specific configuration files with validation
- Plan for database migrations as part of the CI/CD process
- Use deployment previews for PRs to facilitate easier code reviews
- Include security scanning tools like Snyk or Dependabot from the start
- Consider containerized end-to-end tests with Playwright or Cypress
