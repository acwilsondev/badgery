The analytics features described in Section 3.5 will be implemented after the core platform is established:

- Core user interaction tracking will be included from the beginning
- Organization-wide analytics dashboard will be implemented in a later phase
- Competitive ranking systems and leaderboards will be part of post-POC development
- The database schema will be designed to support these future analytics requirements

### 6.3 Social Integration Approach

For social and external integration (Section 3.6), the implementation will:

- Initially focus on public achievement verification APIs
- Support basic sharing capabilities in early releases
- Defer advanced embedding and portfolio display features to later phases
- Ensure the authentication system accommodates future embedding use cases
