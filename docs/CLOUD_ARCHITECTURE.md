# Cloud Architecture Options

This document outlines three possible deployment architectures for Badgery, each with different trade-offs between control, cost, and maintenance overhead.

## Option 1: Self-Hosted on EC2

### Overview

This approach maximizes control and potential cost savings by running services on EC2 instances.

### Components

- EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group
- Self-managed Nginx load balancer
- Self-managed Docker runtime
- GitHub Actions runner on EC2
- CloudWatch for monitoring
- Route 53 for DNS

### Architecture Diagram

```

### Pros

- Maximum control over infrastructure
- Potential cost savings at scale
- No vendor lock-in for container orchestration
- Full control over security policies

### Cons

- Higher maintenance overhead
- Need to manage security patches
- More complex deployment process
- Manual scaling configuration

### Estimated Costs

- EC2 instances (~$30-50/month per instance)
- Load Balancer (~$20/month)
- Route 53 (~$0.50/hosted zone/month)
- Total: Starting at ~$100/month

## Option 2: AWS Managed Services

### Overview

This approach leverages AWS managed services to minimize operational overhead.

### Components

- ECS Fargate for container orchestration
- Application Load Balancer
- ECR for container registry
- CloudWatch for monitoring
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Route 53 for DNS

### Architecture Diagram

```
[ECR] → [ECS Fargate] → [ALB] → [Internet]
            ↑
    [GitHub Actions] → [CodeDeploy]
```

### Pros

- Minimal operational overhead
- Built-in auto-scaling
- Managed security patches
- Simplified deployment process
- Built-in high availability

### Cons

- Higher cost at scale
- Less control over infrastructure
- AWS vendor lock-in
- Cost can be less predictable

### Estimated Costs

- ECS Fargate (~$40-60/month)
- ALB (~$20/month)
- ECR (~$5/month)
- Secrets Manager (~$0.40/secret/month)
- Total: Starting at ~$80/month

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach

### Overview

This approach balances control and convenience by using EC2 for core services and managed services for auxiliary components.

### Components

- EC2 instances for application containers
- ECS EC2 launch type
- Application Load Balancer (managed)
- ECR for container registry
- CloudWatch for monitoring
- Systems Manager for configuration
- Route 53 for DNS

### Architecture Diagram

```
[ECR] → [ECS on EC2] → [ALB] → [Internet]
            ↑
    [GitHub Actions] → [CodeDeploy]
```

### Pros

- More control over compute resources
- Better cost optimization possibilities
- Managed container orchestration
- Flexible scaling options

### Cons

- Moderate operational overhead
- Need to manage EC2 instances
- Mixed complexity in deployment
- Requires more AWS expertise

### Estimated Costs

- EC2 instances (~$30-50/month per instance)
- ALB (~$20/month)
- ECR (~$5/month)
- Systems Manager (free for basic usage)
- Total: Starting at ~$60/month

## Option 4: Indie Self-Host Stack

### Overview

This approach prioritizes simplicity and familiarity for developers comfortable with docker-compose, targeting single-VPS deployments common in indie hacking and small-scale applications.

### Components

- Single VPS (e.g., $5-10/month DigitalOcean droplet)
- Docker with docker-compose
- Traefik for SSL and reverse proxy
- Watchtower for automatic container updates
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Backblaze B2 or S3-compatible storage for backups
- Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring (optional)

### Architecture Diagram

```
[GitHub Actions] → [Docker Hub] → [Watchtower]
                                  ↓
[Internet] → [Traefik] → [Docker Compose Services]
                ↓
            [LetsEncrypt]
```

### Directory Structure

```
/opt/badgery/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── traefik/
│   ├── config/
│   └── acme/
├── prometheus/
└── grafana/
```

### Deployment Flow

1. Push to main branch
2. GitHub Actions builds and pushes to Docker Hub
3. Watchtower detects new image and performs rolling update
4. Traefik automatically handles SSL and routing

### Pros

- Simplest deployment model
- Lowest cost for small scale
- Familiar tooling (docker-compose)
- Easy to replicate locally
- Full control over infrastructure
- Easy to migrate between providers
- Simple backup strategy

### Cons

- Manual scaling
- Single point of failure
- More hands-on maintenance
- Limited geographic distribution
- No automatic failover

### Estimated Costs

- VPS (~$5-10/month)
- Domain + SSL (free with Let's Encrypt)
- Backups (~$5/month)
- Total: Starting at ~$10-15/month

### Scaling Strategy

1. Start with single VPS
2. Scale vertically (increase VPS size) as needed
3. Add read replicas if needed
4. Consider migration to Option 1 or 2 at scale

### Disaster Recovery

1. Regular backups to S3-compatible storage
2. Documented restore procedure
3. Configuration managed in git
4. Automated restore testing

## Recommendation

For Badgery's initial deployment, we recommend Option 2 (AWS Managed Services) because:

1. **Time to Market**: Fastest path to production with minimal operational setup
2. **Operational Simplicity**: Reduces maintenance burden on the development team
3. **Scalability**: Built-in auto-scaling and high availability
4. **Security**: Managed security patches and updates
5. **Cost Predictability**: While not the cheapest option, costs are more predictable
6. **Future Flexibility**: Can migrate to other options as needs evolve

For indie developers and small-scale deployments, Option 4 (Indie Self-Host Stack) provides the best balance of:

1. **Cost Efficiency**: Lowest starting costs
2. **Simplicity**: Familiar tools and straightforward deployment
3. **Control**: Full access to infrastructure
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to migrate between providers
5. **Learning Curve**: Minimal new tools to learn

### Migration Plan

If we need to migrate to a different option in the future:

1. Since we're using containers, our application is portable
2. We can gradually migrate by running hybrid deployments
3. Infrastructure is defined as code, making it easier to reproduce in different configurations
4. Blue/green deployment strategy allows for safe cutover

## Next Steps

1. Implement initial infrastructure using AWS CDK
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
3. Configure monitoring and alerting
4. Document operational procedures
5. Create cost monitoring dashboard
