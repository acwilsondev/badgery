### STORY-1.1: Modern Application Stack Setup (AI Complexity: **S**)

**I want** a Remix application with the latest React features and TypeScript configurations
**So that** the codebase is built on modern, performant technologies from the start.

**Tasks:**

- Initialize Remix v2+ application with React 18+ features
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Set up ESLint and Prettier with enforced code style rules
- Configure path aliases for cleaner imports

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Application uses latest stable versions of Remix and React
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled with proper type checking
- Code styling is automatically enforced via ESLint and Prettier
- Developers can use consistent import patterns with path aliases

**AI Complexity: S** Setting up a modern application stack requires knowledge of current JavaScript frameworks and tooling but follows established patterns.

### STORY-1.2: Containerized Development Environment (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** developer
**I want** a consistent containerized development environment
**So that** all team members can work with identical dependencies and configurations.

**Tasks:**

- Create Docker development configuration with hot reloading
- Implement Docker production configuration with optimizations
- Configure appropriate volume mounting for efficient development
- Add container health checks for all services
- Set up multi-stage builds to optimize container size
- Create Docker Compose for local development with dependent services

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Developers can start the application with a single Docker command
- Changes to code are immediately reflected via hot reloading
- Production builds are optimized for performance and size
- Health checks verify container status for orchestration tools
- Local environment includes all necessary dependent services

**AI Complexity: M** Configuring Docker environments requires understanding of containerization concepts and service orchestration.
