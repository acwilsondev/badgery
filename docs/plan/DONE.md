### STORY-1.1: Modern Application Stack Setup (AI Complexity: **S**)

**I want** a Remix application with the latest React features and TypeScript configurations
**So that** the codebase is built on modern, performant technologies from the start.

**Tasks:**

- Initialize Remix v2+ application with React 18+ features
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Set up ESLint and Prettier with enforced code style rules
- Configure path aliases for cleaner imports

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Application uses latest stable versions of Remix and React
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled with proper type checking
- Code styling is automatically enforced via ESLint and Prettier
- Developers can use consistent import patterns with path aliases

**AI Complexity: S** Setting up a modern application stack requires knowledge of current JavaScript frameworks and tooling but follows established patterns.

### STORY-1.2: Containerized Development Environment (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** developer
**I want** a consistent containerized development environment
**So that** all team members can work with identical dependencies and configurations.

**Tasks:**

- Create Docker development configuration with hot reloading
- Implement Docker production configuration with optimizations
- Configure appropriate volume mounting for efficient development
- Add container health checks for all services
- Set up multi-stage builds to optimize container size
- Create Docker Compose for local development with dependent services

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Developers can start the application with a single Docker command
- Changes to code are immediately reflected via hot reloading
- Production builds are optimized for performance and size
- Health checks verify container status for orchestration tools
- Local environment includes all necessary dependent services

**AI Complexity: M** Configuring Docker environments requires understanding of containerization concepts and service orchestration.

### STORY-1.3: Continuous Integration Pipeline (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** developer
**I want** a robust CI pipeline with automated checks and security scanning
**So that** code quality and security can be verified automatically before merging

**Tasks:**

- [x] GitHub Actions PR Workflow

  - Set up TypeScript type checking
  - Configure Vitest unit tests
  - Implement ESLint code style checks
  - Add Prettier format verification
  - Configure test coverage reporting

- [x] Security Scanning

  - [x] Set up Snyk for dependency scanning
  - [x] Configure npm audit checks
  - [x] Add CodeQL for code analysis
  - [x] Implement Docker image scanning

- [ ] Code Quality Gates

  - [ ] Configure branch protection rules
  - [ ] Set up required status checks
  - [x] Define code coverage thresholds
  - [x] Implement pull request templates

- [x] Documentation Checks
  - [x] Verify README updates
  - [x] Check for API documentation updates
  - [x] Validate TypeScript declarations
  - [x] Ensure changelog updates

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- All PRs automatically run:
  - Unit tests with coverage report
  - TypeScript type checking
  - ESLint and Prettier verification
  - Security vulnerability scanning
  - Docker image security checks
- Failed checks block PR merging
- Test results are clearly reported in PR
- Security issues are automatically created as PR comments
- Code coverage meets minimum thresholds
- Documentation is verified for completeness

**Technical Constraints:**

- Use GitHub Actions for CI
- Use Vitest for testing
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code style
- Use Snyk and CodeQL for security
- Use TypeScript in strict mode

**Estimated Timeline:**

- Basic CI Setup: 1 day
- Security Scanning: 1 day
- Quality Gates: 0.5 day
- Documentation Checks: 0.5 day
  Total: 3 days

**AI Complexity: M** Setting up comprehensive CI requires understanding of testing practices, security tools, and automated quality checks.
