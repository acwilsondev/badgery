# Epic 12: Rule-Based Achievement System

_Note: This Epic was promoted from STORY-6.2 in the original plan._

Aligns with Milestone 2: Feature Expansion

## Overview

The Rule-Based Achievement System provides a way to automatically assign achievements to users based on predefined rules and conditions. This system allows organizations to set up achievement criteria that automatically trigger when users meet specific requirements, reducing the need for manual achievement assignment.

## User Stories

### STORY-12.1: Rule Definition Interface (AI Complexity: **S**)

**As an** organization administrator,  
**I want** a user-friendly interface to define achievement rules,  
**So that** I can create automated conditions for achievement assignment.

**Tasks:**

- Design rule builder interface
- Implement rule components and conditions
- Create rule validation logic
- Build rule testing functionality
- Add rule versioning support

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Admins can create and modify achievement rules through a visual interface
- Rules can include multiple conditions and logical operators
- Rule validation prevents creation of invalid or conflicting rules
- Rules can be tested with sample data before activation
- Rules track version history for audit purposes

**AI Complexity: S**
Creating a rule definition interface involves designing an intuitive UI with proper validation. The complexity is moderate, focusing on making complex rule creation accessible to non-technical users.

### STORY-12.2: Rule Execution Engine (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** platform operator,  
**I want** a reliable engine to evaluate achievement rules,  
**So that** users are awarded achievements automatically when they meet criteria.

**Tasks:**

- Design rule evaluation architecture
- Implement rule matching algorithm
- Create efficient event processing
- Build rule execution logging
- Add performance optimization for rule evaluation

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Rules are evaluated correctly against user activities
- Rule processing is performant even with many concurrent events
- Rule execution is logged for audit and debugging
- System handles rule evaluation failures gracefully
- Achievement assignment is triggered automatically on rule match

**AI Complexity: M**
Building a rule execution engine requires designing efficient algorithms for matching events against rules. The complexity comes from ensuring performance while handling potentially complex rule conditions.

### STORY-12.3: Event Capture System (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a system to capture user events for rule processing,  
**So that** the rule engine has the necessary data to evaluate achievement criteria.

**Tasks:**

- Design event capture architecture
- Implement event ingestion API
- Create event validation and normalization
- Build event storage and retention
- Add event tagging and categorization

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- System captures relevant events from multiple sources
- Events are validated and normalized to a standard format
- Event storage is scalable and performant
- Events are properly categorized for efficient rule matching
- Historical events can be replayed for rule testing

**AI Complexity: M**
Creating an event capture system requires handling data from various sources in a reliable way. The complexity comes from ensuring proper validation and storage of potentially high-volume event data.

### STORY-12.4: Rule Analytics and Monitoring (AI Complexity: **S**)

**As an** organization administrator,  
**I want** insights into rule performance and execution,  
**So that** I can optimize my achievement rules and understand their effectiveness.

**Tasks:**

- Design rule analytics dashboard
- Implement rule execution metrics
- Create rule effectiveness visualization
- Build rule impact reporting
- Add anomaly detection for rule issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Admins can view metrics on rule executions and matches
- Dashboard shows which rules are triggering most frequently
- Reports indicate the effectiveness of achievement rules
- Potential issues with rules are highlighted automatically
- Historical trends in rule execution are visible

**AI Complexity: S**
Implementing rule analytics involves standard data visualization and metrics collection. The complexity is moderate, focusing on presenting actionable insights about rule performance.

## Comments

As an engineer implementing this epic, I recommend:

- Use a rules engine framework (Drools, Easy Rules) rather than building from scratch
- Implement a domain-specific language (DSL) for more expressive rule creation
- Consider using CEP (Complex Event Processing) for real-time rule evaluation
- Add support for time-based rules (e.g., "complete 5 tasks within 1 week")
- Implement rule priority/ordering to handle conflicting rule scenarios
- Add support for rule categories/namespaces for better organization
- Implement rule simulation capabilities to test rule changes against historical data
- Consider performance implications with database design - use materialized views or event sourcing
- Add support for parameterized rules that can be reused with different thresholds
- Implement dynamic rule modification without service restart
- Create a rule debugging tool that shows evaluation steps and matched conditions
- Add support for compound achievements that require multiple rule conditions
- Implement achievement progression tracking with partial credit
- Consider batch processing for rules against historical data when rules change
- Add support for achievement expiration or seasonal achievements
- Implement caching strategies for frequently evaluated rules
- Create a rule marketplace to share common rule templates between organizations
- Consider implementing an achievement recommendation system based on user behavior
