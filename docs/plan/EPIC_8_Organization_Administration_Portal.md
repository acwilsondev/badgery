- Add SSO integration options (SAML, OIDC) for enterprise organizations
- Create organization-level API usage dashboards with cost estimation
- Implement organization-wide announcements and communication tools
- Design with localization support from the beginning (i18n)
- Add organization lifecycle management (trial, active, suspended, archived)
- Create guided onboarding flows for new organization administrators
- Consider implementing team hierarchy/nesting capabilities
