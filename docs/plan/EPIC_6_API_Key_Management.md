# Epic 6: API Key Management

_Note: This Epic was promoted from STORY-3.2 in the original plan._

Aligns with Milestone 1: Foundation & CI/CD

## User Stories

### STORY-6.1: API Key Generation System (AI Complexity: **S**)

**As an** organization administrator,  
**I want** to generate secure API keys,  
**So that** my systems can authenticate with the achievement platform.

**Tasks:**

- Design secure API key format
- Implement key generation algorithm
- Create key storage mechanism
- Build key revocation functionality
- Add key expiration handling

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Generated API keys follow security best practices
- Keys are stored securely (hashed) in the database
- Keys can be revoked immediately when needed
- Key expiration is handled gracefully

**AI Complexity: S**
Implementing API key generation requires understanding of security practices for key generation and storage. The complexity is moderate as it involves careful handling of cryptographic operations.

### STORY-6.2: API Key Management UI (AI Complexity: **S**)

**As an** organization administrator,  
**I want** a user interface to manage API keys,  
**So that** I can create, view, and revoke keys as needed.

**Tasks:**

- Design API key management interface
- Implement key creation workflow
- Create key listing and details view
- Build key revocation interface
- Add key usage statistics display

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Admins can create new API keys with descriptions
- Existing keys can be viewed and managed
- Keys can be revoked through the UI
- Basic usage statistics are displayed for each key

**AI Complexity: S**
Creating a management UI for API keys follows standard UI patterns for resource management. The complexity is relatively low, focusing on clear presentation of key information and actions.

### STORY-6.3: Rate Limiting Implementation (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** platform operator,  
**I want** to implement rate limiting for API keys,  
**So that** the system is protected from abuse or excessive usage.

**Tasks:**

- Design rate limiting architecture
- Implement rate limiting algorithms
- Create configurable limits per key
- Build rate limit response handling
- Add rate limit monitoring and alerts

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- API requests are rate limited based on key
- Rate limits can be configured per API key
- Rate limit responses follow standards (429 status)
- Admins can monitor rate limit usage and violations

**AI Complexity: M**
Implementing rate limiting requires understanding of distributed systems and performance considerations. The complexity comes from creating an efficient system that can track requests across potentially distributed infrastructure.

### STORY-6.4: API Usage Analytics (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As an** organization administrator,  
**I want** detailed usage analytics for my API keys,  
**So that** I can monitor and optimize my integration.

**Tasks:**

- Design API usage metrics collection
- Implement analytics data aggregation
- Create usage dashboards and visualizations
- Build usage reporting functionality
- Add anomaly detection for unusual patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Key usage statistics are collected and stored
- Usage dashboards show patterns and trends
- Reports can be generated for specific time periods
- Unusual usage patterns trigger alerts

**AI Complexity: M**
Creating API usage analytics requires designing efficient metrics collection and meaningful visualizations. The complexity comes from aggregating data without impacting performance and detecting meaningful patterns.

## Comments

As an engineer implementing this epic, I recommend:

- Use a secure random generator for API key creation with sufficient entropy
- Implement key scoping to limit API permissions (read-only, specific resources, etc.)
- Consider implementing client IP restrictions for API keys as an additional security measure
- Store only hashed versions of API keys using a strong algorithm like bcrypt
- Implement a grace period mechanism when keys are revoked to prevent immediate service disruption
- Add support for multiple active keys per organization to facilitate key rotation
- Implement gradual rate limit tiers that provide warnings before hard limits
- Consider a distributed rate limiting solution like Redis to handle scale
- Create detailed audit logs for all API key management activities
- Implement automated notifications for key expiration, approaching rate limits, etc.
- Design the system to support different rate limit policies (sliding window, fixed window, etc.)
- Add observability by exporting API usage metrics to monitoring systems like Prometheus
- Consider implementing API quotas (daily/monthly limits) in addition to rate limiting
- Add support for custom rate limit headers to help clients adapt
- Implement retry-after header in rate limit responses to guide client behavior
