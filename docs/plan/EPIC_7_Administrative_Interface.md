# Epic 7: Administrative Interface

This Epic focuses on creating comprehensive administrative interfaces to manage and monitor the platform. It includes the development of dashboards, organization management tools, user management capabilities, and system configuration interfaces.

_Note: This Epic was promoted from STORY-4.1 in the original plan._

Aligns with Milestone 2: Feature Expansion

## User Stories

### STORY-7.1: Site Admin Dashboard (AI Complexity: **S**)

**As a** site administrator,  
**I want** a comprehensive dashboard with system statistics,  
**So that** I can monitor the overall health and usage of the platform.

**Tasks:**

- Design admin dashboard layout
- Implement key metrics visualization
- Create system health indicators
- Build recent activity feed
- Add quick action shortcuts

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Dashboard displays key system metrics
- System health and status are clearly indicated
- Recent important activities are visible
- Common actions are accessible via shortcuts

**AI Complexity: S**  
Creating an admin dashboard involves standard UI patterns for data visualization and layout. The complexity is moderate, focusing on presenting relevant information effectively.

### STORY-7.2: Organization Management (AI Complexity: **S**)

**As a** site administrator,  
**I want** tools to manage organizations on the platform,  
**So that** I can create, configure, and monitor organization accounts.

**Tasks:**

- Design organization management interface
- Implement organization CRUD operations
- Create organization settings configuration
- Build organization usage reporting
- Add organization status management

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Admins can create, update, and delete organizations
- Organization settings can be configured
- Usage reports provide insights into organization activity
- Organization status (active, suspended, etc.) can be managed

**AI Complexity: S**  
Creating organization management tools follows standard CRUD patterns with additional configuration options. The complexity is moderate, focusing on comprehensive management capabilities.

### STORY-7.3: User Management Tools (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** site administrator,  
**I want** advanced user management capabilities,  
**So that** I can handle user accounts, roles, and permissions across the platform.

**Tasks:**

- Design user management interface
- Implement user search and filtering
- Create role assignment functionality
- Build permission management
- Add user activity auditing

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Admins can search and filter users by various criteria
- User roles can be viewed and modified
- Granular permissions can be managed
- User activity history is accessible for audit purposes

**AI Complexity: M**  
Implementing comprehensive user management requires handling complex permission structures and role hierarchies. The complexity comes from ensuring secure access controls while maintaining usability.

### STORY-7.4: System Configuration Interface (AI Complexity: **S**)

**As a** site administrator,  
**I want** a centralized system configuration interface,  
**So that** I can adjust platform settings without technical intervention.

**Tasks:**

- Design system configuration UI
- Implement configuration storage mechanism
- Create configuration validation
- Build configuration history/versioning
- Add environment-specific configuration options

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- System settings can be viewed and modified through the UI
- Changes are validated to prevent invalid configurations
- Configuration history is maintained for audit and rollback
- Different environments can have separate configurations

**AI Complexity: S**  
Creating a system configuration interface involves designing a flexible settings model and validation. The complexity is moderate as it requires careful handling of system-wide settings.

## Comments

As an engineer implementing this epic, I recommend:

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for the admin interface with granular permissions
- Design the admin dashboard with customizable widgets that admins can arrange
- Add a dark mode option for the admin interface to reduce eye strain
- Implement audit logging for all administrative actions with user, timestamp, IP address, and changes made
- Add impersonation capability for admins to troubleshoot user-specific issues
- Implement scheduled data exports and reports that can be emailed to stakeholders
- Design a notification system within the admin interface for important system events
- Add two-factor authentication for admin accounts as an added security measure
- Create a feedback mechanism for admins to report issues or suggest improvements
- Consider implementing user session management (view/terminate active sessions)
- Add bulk operations for user and organization management
- Implement contextual help and documentation within the admin interface
- Design with progressive disclosure in mind - show basic options first with advanced options tucked away
- Consider implementing feature flags to gradually roll out new features
- Add change propagation visualization to show how configuration changes affect the system
