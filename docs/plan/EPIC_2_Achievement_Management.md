# Epic 2: Achievement Management

Aligns with Milestone 1: Foundation & CI/CD

## Description

This epic focuses on the core functionality for defining and creating achievements within the platform. It enables organization administrators to create custom achievements with associated metadata, which forms the foundation of the achievement tracking system.

## User Stories

### STORY-2.1: Achievement Definition & Creation (AI Complexity: **S**)

**As an** organization administrator,  
**I want** to create and define custom achievements,  
**So that** I can recognize specific accomplishments within my organization.

**Tasks:**

- Create achievement definition UI for organization admins
- Implement backend API for achievement CRUD operations
- Build validation and error handling
- Design achievement templates
- Add support for achievement icons/badges

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Organization admins can create, edit, and delete achievements
- Achievements support custom titles, descriptions, and icons
- Validation prevents invalid achievement definitions
- Achievement templates can be saved and reused

**AI Complexity: S**  
Creating CRUD operations for achievements follows standard patterns, though it requires understanding validation requirements and designing an intuitive UI for achievement creation. The primary complexity is in ensuring proper validation and template functionality.

## Comments

As an engineer implementing this epic, I recommend:

- Design the achievement schema with extensibility in mind - we may need to add new properties later
- Consider using a NoSQL database like MongoDB for flexible achievement schema evolution
- Implement a drag-and-drop badge builder UI for better UX
- Support SVG and PNG formats for achievement icons with proper size/resolution guidelines
- Plan for internationalization from the beginning with translatable achievement fields
- Consider implementing categories/tags for achievements to improve organization
- Use optimistic UI updates for faster feedback when creating/editing achievements
- Implement achievement preview functionality to see how it will appear to users
- Consider versioning for achievements to track changes over time
- Add duplicate/clone functionality to speed up creation of similar achievements
- Implement bulk operations for managing multiple achievements at once
