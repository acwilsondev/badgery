# Epic 11: Webhook System Implementation

_Note: This Epic was promoted from STORY-6.1 in the original plan._

## Milestone Alignment

Aligns with Milestone 2: Feature Expansion

## User Stories

### STORY-11.1: Webhook Configuration Interface (AI Complexity: **S**)

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to configure webhooks through a user interface,  
**So that** I can set up event notifications without writing code.

**Tasks:**

- Design webhook configuration UI
- Implement webhook CRUD operations
- Create event type selection
- Build webhook testing tools
- Add webhook status monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Webhooks can be created, updated, and deleted through the UI
- Available event types can be selected for notification
- Webhooks can be tested without triggering real events
- Webhook status and recent deliveries are visible

**AI Complexity: S**
Creating a webhook configuration interface follows standard UI patterns for resource management. The complexity is moderate, focusing on providing comprehensive configuration options.

### STORY-11.2: Webhook Event Delivery System (AI Complexity: **L**)

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a reliable webhook delivery system,  
**So that** external systems receive event notifications consistently.

**Tasks:**

- Design webhook delivery architecture
- Implement asynchronous delivery queue
- Create retry mechanism with backoff
- Build payload signing for security
- Add delivery monitoring and logging

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Events are delivered reliably to webhook endpoints
- Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff
- Payloads are signed for verification
- Delivery attempts are logged for troubleshooting
- System handles high event volumes without performance issues

**AI Complexity: L**
Implementing a reliable webhook delivery system requires deep understanding of distributed systems and failure handling. The high complexity comes from ensuring event delivery in the face of network issues and endpoint failures.

### STORY-11.3: Custom Payload Templates (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to customize webhook payload formats,  
**So that** I can match the requirements of my external systems.

**Tasks:**

- Design template system for payloads
- Implement template rendering engine
- Create template variables for event data
- Build template testing tools
- Add versioning for payload formats

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Webhook payloads can be customized via templates
- Templates include variables from event data
- Templates can be tested with sample data
- Multiple payload versions can be maintained
- Template errors are detected and reported

**AI Complexity: M**
Creating custom payload templates requires designing a flexible but user-friendly templating system. The complexity comes from balancing expressiveness with safety and performance.

### STORY-11.4: Webhook Security Controls (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** platform operator,  
**I want** comprehensive security controls for webhooks,  
**So that** webhook integration is secure and protected from abuse.

**Tasks:**

- Design webhook security architecture
- Implement signature verification
- Create IP restriction options
- Build rate limiting for webhooks
- Add secret rotation mechanism

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Webhooks can be verified using signatures
- IP restrictions can limit delivery to trusted networks
- Rate limiting prevents excessive notifications
- Webhook secrets can be rotated without downtime
- Security events are logged for audit purposes

**AI Complexity: M**
Implementing webhook security controls requires understanding of API security best practices. The complexity comes from creating multiple security layers that work together effectively.

## Comments

As an engineer implementing this epic, I recommend:

- Use a message queue system (RabbitMQ, SQS, Kafka) for webhook delivery
- Implement idempotency keys to prevent duplicate webhook processing
- Add support for webhook batching to reduce API calls during high volume
- Implement circuit breakers for failing webhook endpoints to prevent system overload
- Consider supporting different authentication methods (HMAC, JWT, OAuth2)
- Add comprehensive webhook delivery metrics for observability
- Create a webhook event simulator for testing purpose
- Implement payload compression for large webhook data
- Add support for webhook filtering to allow subscribers to receive only specific events
- Consider implementing a fan-out architecture for high-volume webhooks
- Create a webhook debugger that shows detailed delivery information
- Add support for webhook subscriptions via the API
- Implement webhooks throttling based on endpoint response times
- Add timeout configuration options for webhook deliveries
- Consider implementing a dead letter queue for failed webhooks
- Add webhook logging with appropriate PII controls
- Support webhook payload transformations (JSON to XML, format conversion, etc.)
- Create webhook delivery SLAs and monitor compliance
