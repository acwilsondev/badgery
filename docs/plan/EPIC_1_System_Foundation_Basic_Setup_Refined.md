## Comments

As an engineer implementing this epic, I recommend:

- Use Remix v2+ with the newest React 18+ features for better performance
- Consider setting up a monorepo structure (using Turborepo or similar) if we anticipate having shared packages
- For Docker, include both development and production configurations with proper volume mounting for hot reloading
- Implement health checks in Docker configurations for better container orchestration
- Set up ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode from day one
- For CI/CD, configure separate workflows for PR checks vs. deployments
- Consider using environment-specific configuration files with validation
- Plan for database migrations as part of the CI/CD process
- Use deployment previews for PRs to facilitate easier code reviews
- Include security scanning tools like Snyk or Dependabot from the start
- Consider containerized end-to-end tests with Playwright or Cypress
