# Epic 5: REST API Development

_Note: This Epic was promoted from STORY-3.1 in the original plan._

Aligns with Milestone 1: Foundation & CI/CD

## User Stories

### STORY-5.1: API Authentication Framework (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a secure authentication system for the API,  
**So that** only authorized users and systems can access API resources.

**Tasks:**

- Design API authentication framework
- Implement token-based authentication
- Create role-based access control
- Build API key validation mechanism
- Add authentication failure handling and logging

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- API requests are properly authenticated
- Different authentication methods (token, API key) are supported
- Role-based permissions restrict access appropriately
- Authentication failures are logged and handled securely

**AI Complexity: M**
Implementing API authentication requires understanding security principles and token management. The complexity comes from creating a system that is both secure and flexible for different authentication scenarios.

### STORY-5.2: Core Resource Endpoints (AI Complexity: **S**)

**As a** developer,  
**I want** API endpoints for core resources (achievements, users, organizations),  
**So that** I can programmatically access and manipulate these resources.

**Tasks:**

- Design RESTful endpoint structure for core resources
- Implement CRUD operations for each resource
- Create appropriate request/response schemas
- Add validation for all API inputs
- Build response formatting

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- All core resources have complete CRUD endpoints
- Endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- Requests and responses are properly validated and formatted
- Error handling is consistent across endpoints

**AI Complexity: S**
Creating API endpoints for core resources follows RESTful design patterns. While the implementation is straightforward, careful attention to consistent validation and error handling is required.

### STORY-5.3: Advanced Query and Filtering (AI Complexity: **M**)

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to filter and query API resources efficiently,  
**So that** I can retrieve precisely the data I need.

**Tasks:**

- Design query parameter schema
- Implement filtering mechanisms
- Create sorting and pagination
- Build optimized database queries
- Add response metadata for pagination

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- API supports filtering by various attributes
- Sorting can be applied to relevant fields
- Pagination limits response size for performance
- Queries are optimized to avoid performance issues

**AI Complexity: M**
Implementing advanced querying requires balancing flexibility with performance. The complexity comes from translating query parameters into efficient database queries while preventing potential abuse.

### STORY-5.4: API Documentation Generation (AI Complexity: **S**)

**As a** developer,  
**I want** comprehensive API documentation,  
**So that** I can easily understand how to use the API.

**Tasks:**

- Set up API documentation framework (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Create detailed endpoint documentation
- Build interactive API explorer
- Generate code examples for common operations
- Implement documentation versioning

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Documentation covers all API endpoints
- Interactive explorer allows testing requests
- Code examples are provided for multiple languages
- Documentation is versioned with the API

**AI Complexity: S**
Generating API documentation requires attention to detail and clear explanations. The complexity is moderate as it involves setting up documentation frameworks and ensuring comprehensive coverage.

## Comments

As an engineer implementing this epic, I recommend:

- Implement OAuth 2.0 with refresh tokens and proper expiration policies
- Use JWT for stateless authentication but consider token size limitations
- Implement rate limiting with graduated thresholds based on client tier
- Design the API with clear versioning strategy (URL path, header, or content negotiation)
- Consider using JSON:API or GraphQL for more complex data relationships
- Implement HATEOAS principles for better API discoverability
- Use consistent error response format with proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- Implement request/response compression for performance
- Add API metrics collection for monitoring (response times, error rates, etc.)
- Set up automated API contract testing
- Create a developer portal with API key self-service and usage analytics
- Consider implementing a public roadmap for API development
- Implement API throttling for large result sets to protect backend resources
- Add support for conditional requests (If-Modified-Since, ETag) to reduce bandwidth
- Use standardized timestamp format (ISO 8601) throughout the API
