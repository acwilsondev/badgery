- **S**: Low complexity - requires some understanding of context but follows established patterns
- **M**: Medium complexity - requires understanding of multiple systems or nuanced decision making
- **L**: High complexity - requires deep understanding of business logic, security implications, or complex integration
- **XL**: Very high complexity - requires advanced reasoning, highly ambiguous requirements, or cutting-edge techniques
- **XXL**: Extremely complex - requires specialized expertise, novel approaches, or extensive domain knowledge that exceeds current AI capabilities

## Release Strategy

The development is organized into four major releases:

1. **Foundation Release (MVP)**: Core functionality for achievement tracking and management
2. **Integration Release**: Enhanced features including webhooks, sharing, and admin interfaces
